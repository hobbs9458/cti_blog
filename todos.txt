streamline error handling process and responses from api

add google analytics 

make form inputs smaller on vending request? maybe having two inputs per line? maybe use grid for that? then bring back to 1 input per line on mobile

update logistics email to actual logistics email in .env

make sure link in vending submissions email is working. do redirect for when they're not logged in

make sure you are double checking roles on the backend before performing updates

add status codes to api responses

limit session length time, add exp to session

move check session on access page to back end

handle redirect: make checkSession() api route and make layout component's client component. use useEffect to check session and handle redirects

handle excel upload notifications

make comment component

could make marking items complete and emailing more robust. right now it's relying on the exact string indicating that the request has been updated to complete

may change /access to /portal

trying to go to contact page from /access is not working right
