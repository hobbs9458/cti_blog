web notifications:
  -entry: sales rep, logistics, submitter
  -approval: IT, sales rep, logistics
  -denied: sales rep, logistics
  -comment: commenter, sales rep, logistics

NOTES:

when status changes to approved it notifies IT. It's kind of a brittle setup so if you change the way the updates are written you will need to change how to notify IT
